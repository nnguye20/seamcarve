HANDIN: This is intended to be my final handin

DESIGN CHOICES: I wrote class myPicturePane with the following methods: findLowestCostSeam, 
fillCostsAndDirs, argmin, and getImportanceValues.

I delegated cost/direction array functionality to the helper method fillCostsAndDirs() for 
organizational purposes. Also, for readability, I chose to initialize the costs/dirs arrays
within findLowestCostSeam, rather than have fillCostsAndDirs() be a getter method that returns
an 2 x 1 array holding the two arrays (seemed confusing). I also called 

Note that the middleDownPixel can never be out bounds, so I did not check boundaries for such 
pixel in fillCostsAndDirs().


KNOWN BUGS: Something may be wrong with my Eclipse seamcarve package, as I couldn't 
figure out how to run the program directly from Terminal (e.g. java seamcarve.App)
